    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>

    <p>Black Country Vets was founded with a deep-rooted love for animals and a passion for providing top-notch care.
        Our
        journey began over 10 years ago when our founder realized the need for a caring, local veterinary service.
        Starting
        with a humble dream to give every pet the best care possible, weâ€™ve grown into a trusted name in animal care,
        offering
        professional veterinary services for all pets, big and small.</p>

        services
        and welcome referrals from across the UK. If you're located in places like Wolverhampton, Stourbridge, West
